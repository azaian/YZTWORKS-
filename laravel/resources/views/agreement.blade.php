                                Client. These deliverables may include data and report production or report display (for

                                subscription basis. These subscriptions are usually provided on an annual basis. At the

                                provided as deliverables by Company. In other words, after a copy of the report is
                                delivered, Client does

                                not own or have access to the data and report templates that are offered or stored on
